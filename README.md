# wp-theme
Wordpress Theme based upon Bootstrap 3 (yes, it's that old).

I used this, mostly successfully for my old blog but I've since switched to GitHub Pages.

Feel free to take and use as you wish :)

> I have no use for this theme anymore, so I won't be fully maintining this. If you send a pull request, please share a link to where I can see any changes in action.
